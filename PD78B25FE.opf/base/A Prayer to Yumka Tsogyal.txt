A Prayer to Yumka Tsogyal
by Apang Tertön

emaho
Emaho!
chöying tröpa dralwé podrang né
In the dharmadhātu palace of natural simplicity
chöku gyalwa yumchen la solwa deb
Is the dharmakāya, Great Mother of the buddhas—to you I pray:
ma dak rangshyin künshyi bakchak tsok
Bless me, so that all habitual patterns of the impure ālaya
dakpa nyiden chökur jingyi lob
May be realized as the dharmakāya of twofold purity!

gakmé yeshe köpa lhün gyi drub
In the spontaneously present land of unimpeded wisdom
longku dorjé pakmo la solwa deb
Is the sambhogakāya Vajravārāhī—to you I pray:
lé lung künshyi namshé nyön yi sok
Bless me, so that karmic winds, ālaya, defiled mental consciousness and so forth
duk nga yeshe nga ru jingyi lob
May be purified as the five poisons are realized as the five wisdoms!

tukjé drowa dulwé podrang né
In the palace of taming sentient beings with compassion
tulku yeshe tsogyal la solwa deb
Is the nirmāṇakāya, Yeshe Tsogyal—to you I pray:
lobur küntok trulpa rang sar shyik
Bless me, so that momentary concepts and confusion may naturally vanish,
ku sum gongpa ngöngyur jingyi lob
And I may realize the enlightened mind of the Three Kāyas!

di né zung té tserab tamché du
From now on, throughout all my lives to come,
lama khandrö tukjé jezung shying
May the Gurus and Ḍākinīs care for me with compassion!
dorjé tekpé lam chok rabtu nyé
May I fully engage with the sublime path of the Vajrayāna,
kunzang dömé shyi la changchub shok
And awaken into the primordial ground of Samantabhadra!

If you devotedly pray in this way, you will be cared for by the Wisdom Ḍākinī. Samaya. Seal.
Seal. Seal.

At the request of Ngawang Chöphel, this was written by Trinlé Lingpa.
