A Prayer to Chöying Dorje
by Apang Tertön

gyalwa kün ngö orgyen pema jung
Orgyen Pema Jungne, embodiment of all the buddhas,
drubpé wangchuk tangtong chak zampa
And Thangtong Gyalpo, lord of siddhas and builder of iron bridges,
yermé sangdak chöying dorjé la
Are indivisible from you, Chöying Dorje, Lord of Secrets.
solwa deb so chi nang barché sol
I pray to you: dispel outer and inner obstacles!

sem kyi rangshyin ösal ngön du gyur
Let me actualize clear light, the very nature of my mind,
trulnang chö kün milam tabur tok
Recognize all dharmas of deluded perception as dream-like,
trekchö tögal gongpa ta ru chin
And perfect the realization of Cutting Through and Direct Crossing!
dön nyi lhün gyi drubpar jingyi lob
Bless me, that I may spontaneously accomplish the twofold benefit!

At the request of the carefree Jangchub Dorje, this was written by Pawo Chöying Dorje. May it
be virtuous!
